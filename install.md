# How to Install and Run The Last Floor

Thank you for your interest in our 3D horror game! Here are the steps to clone and run our game in Unity:

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone our GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://gitlab.istic.univ-rennes1.fr/rbouhmad/l3_project.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to a local folder.

## Step 2: Open the Project in Unity

Open Unity and click on "Open Project". Browse to the local folder where you cloned or extracted the repository and select the "l3_project" folder.

Unity will now import all the assets and scenes in the project. This may take some time depending on your system's performance and the size of the project (2.7 GB at the time of writing).

## Step 3: Play the Game

Once Unity has finished importing the project, you can play the game by opening the "Scenes" folder and double-clicking on the "MainScene" file (not yet implemented, testScene is what's available right now as we're in early development). This will load the main scene of the game.

Please note that the game is currently in development and is not yet buildable. We will release a build only once the game is complete because of the size of the project.

## Project Format

Our 3D horror game is being developed using Unity 2021.3.24f1 and uses C# for scripting. The project contains various scenes, assets, and scripts that are organized into folders within the Assets folder. We recommend using a version of Unity that is compatible with our project to avoid any compatibility issues.

Thank you for your interest in our game, and we hope you enjoy playing it once it's complete!
